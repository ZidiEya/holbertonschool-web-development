# CSS Advanced Project

## üéØ Objective

The goal of this project is to apply advanced CSS styling to a previously built HTML structure. This project builds directly on the `0x02. HTML, advanced` project and uses a Figma design file as the reference for all style-related implementations.

- **Full website layout and styling** based on a professional Figma design.
- Advanced CSS features such as:
  - Flexbox and Grid for responsive layout
  - Custom fonts (`Source Sans Pro`, `Spin Cycle OT`)
  - Hover and transition effects
  - Responsive design via media queries
  - Semantic and accessible code
# CSS Advanced Project

## Overview

This project is a continuation of the **HTML Advanced** project. The previous project focused on building a semantic and well-structured HTML page. Now, the focus shifts to implementing the CSS styles to make the webpage visually match the provided designer files.

You will use a detailed **Figma design** as a reference for styling the page‚Äôs header, banner, quotes, videos list, membership, FAQ, and footer sections.

---

## Objectives

- Import and link a CSS stylesheet (`styles.css`) in the `<head>` of the page.
- Style the **header** and **banner** sections accurately using CSS properties.
- Apply styles to the **quote** section to reflect the design.
- Style the **videos list** section with correct layout and typography.
- Style the **membership** section with images, text, and buttons.
- Style the **FAQ** section with rows and items.
- Style the **footer** including logos, social links, and text.
- Keep CSS clean and simple with easy-to-read selectors.
- Use the exact colors, sizes, and spacing from the Figma design (round float values as needed).
- Deploy the finished webpage using **GitHub Pages**.

## Figma Design

The full design file is available on [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/YourFigmaFileLinkHere).

- Create a Figma account if you don‚Äôt have one.
- Duplicate the file to your drafts for full access.
- Fonts used:
  - Source Sans Pro
  - Spin Cycle OT
- Some measurements may be decimals ‚Äî rounding is acceptable.
- Use the design as a pixel-perfect guide for CSS styling.

## Getting Started

1. Copy the `index.html` file from the previous `html_advanced` project.
2. Create a `styles.css` file and link it inside the `<head>` tag of `index.html`.
3. Use CSS to style all the page sections according to the Figma design.
4. Test your page in a browser to ensure it visually matches the designer‚Äôs wireframe.
5. Commit your changes regularly.
6. When finished, deploy the site to GitHub Pages for live preview.
