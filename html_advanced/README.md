# HTML Advanced Project

## 📌 Overview

This project is part of the Holberton Front-End Curriculum and focuses on building a semantically rich and accessible HTML5 website. It is the foundation for the upcoming `css_advanced` styling project.

You’ll construct a multi-section web page using modern HTML practices and structure it in a way that is clear, accessible, and scalable.

- Use semantic elements like `<header>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<nav>`, `<footer>`, etc.
- Prepare clean HTML markup for future styling
- Organize page content with headings, paragraphs, images, links, and lists
- Use proper indentation and file organization
